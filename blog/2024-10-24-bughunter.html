                    I don't think I was the only one who was under the impression that <em>UFO 50</em> was some sort of fast-paced retro-gaming dream. The idea of a "retro game with modern design aesthetics" conjures up images of fast-paced platformers with a mind for speedrunning.

                <aside><strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>Bughunter</em> was the first <em>UFO 50</em> game I ended up Golding!</aside>

                    So it must've come as a big surprise to find out that the whole collection starts with Barbuta and Bughunter, two games that are similarly deliberate and almost zenlike in their presentation. If Barbuta has you focusing on your movement in an almost methodical, practiced way, Bughunter makes every single move matter all the more.

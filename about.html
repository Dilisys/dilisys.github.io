                Hi, my name is Jan, a real life elf and a real life rabbit in real life.

                There's not much to say about me other than the fact that I love to play and I love to write and I love to create. This entire blog project is my attempt at putting all three of those passions into one thing. The other things I like to do is listen and play music, and do a little cross stitching on the side.
            </p>

                I am also a massive weeb-in-training. But don't tell anyone that.
